**Visualize**: create visualizations e.g charts,graphs,maps, using ggplot 

**Conclude**: draw conclusions from the interesting things discovered 

**Document and post**: publish our work on the web  and then document the project in a report.
 
**How it will contribute to our understanding of R**

Undertaking this project from scratch will give us the opportunity to gain experience in all the different stages of data analysis and reporting in R highlighted above.
